# AppSensor
The AppSensor project defines a conceptual framework and methodology that offers prescriptive guidance to implement application layer intrusion detection and automated response. In addition, there is a reference implementation that provides a toolkit for building self-defending applications through real-time event detection and response [appsensor github](https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor). 

The book describing the framework and methodology are available via [PDF](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/Owasp-appsensor-guide-v2.pdf) or as a physical book on [Lulu](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/owasp-foundation/appsensor-guide/paperback/product-1v92q7d8.html?page=1&pageSize=4)

There is more detailed information about the concepts as well as a getting started set of docs for developers at [appsensor.org](http://www.appsensor.org/)
